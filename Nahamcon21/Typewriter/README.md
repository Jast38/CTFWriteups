Can you recover his work?

Download the file below. Note, this is a large ~400MB file and may take some time to download.

## Solution

First of all we have to analyse the provided file to get the OS of the broken machine.

```
$volatility -f image.bin imageinfo
```
The option **-f** specifies the file to use and **imageinfo** is the respective plugin of
volatility we want to use.
